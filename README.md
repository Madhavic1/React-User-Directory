# Employee Directory

## Overview

The aim of this application is to create an employee directory with React. In this application, the application's UI is broke up into multiple components and by using props and handler functions, the component's state is managed to achieve the functionality and to  respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Description of the functionality of the application

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees will be rendered. 

The user will be able to:

  * Sort the table based on employee's Name and Date of Birth by clicking on the Name and DOB headers.

  * Filter the users by employee's Name and email address.
